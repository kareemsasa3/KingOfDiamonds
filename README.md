### Game Overview

### Set-up

Player limit: 4

Time limit:
* 1 minute/round
* 5 minutes/first round & rounds with new rules

Upon entering, all players shackle themselves to a seat and confirm the operation of the machines. 
Above their heads is an equilibrium stand that fills Aqua Regia, a fuming liquid.

### Rules

__All players remaining:__

* All players select a number between 0 and 100 in a given time.
* The average of those values will be multiplied by 4/5th (0.8).
* The person who chooses the number closest to the calculated number wins. This constitutes one round.
* All losers will lose a point.
* A new rule is introduces for every player eliminated. On the first round and all following rounds where a new rule is introduced, players are allotted 5 minutes as a way to get used to the rules.

__Game Clear:__ Be the last person remaining.

__Game Over:__ Reach -10 points.

Every player who gets a "Game Over" will cause the weight stand to tip over, dumping Aqua Regia and burning the victim.

__4 Players Remaining:__
* If there are 2 people or more who choose the same number, the number they chose becomes invalid, meaning they will lose a point even if the number is closest to 4/5th the average.
  * Due to two players receiving a __Game Over__, this rule was introduced in the __3 players remaining__ announcement instead.

__3 Players Remaining:__
* If there is a person who chooses the exact correct number, the loser penalty is doubled.

__2 Players Remaining:__
* If someone chooses 0, the player who chooses 100 is the winner.

### Strategy

### All Players Left:

Before the beginning of the game, all players assumed that excess logic and mathematics would be the key to the game. 
However, it was quickly realized that it would be within the facet of rationality to eliminate abstract ideas such as nash equilibrium, recursive selection, and cognitive limit.
Additionally, perfect rationality is also perfectly predictable. In truth, the game was simply about reading your opponents and simple calculations. 
For example, choosing a seemingly absurd strategy outside all logic - intentionally picking obscure numbers to round the average into a more favorable value - in order to balance the losses between players so the damage for the King of Diamonds adds up.

### 3 Players Left:

With the addition of the invalidity rule, the strategy for the game completely changes.
Consequently, the number of practical numbers and tactics reduce. Prior, 0 was a strong number but now there's a high risk of choosing the same number.
However, if 0 is avoided and 1 is chosen instead, another player could have the same thought process, yielding the person choosing 0 as the winner.
On the other hand, if the results are | __0/1/2__ | then the player who chooses 1 wins. But there's not much difference between 2 or 100 either.
In the following scenarios: | __0/0/2__ | __0/0/100__ | __2/2/100__ |; 2, 100, and 100 win respectively.
In conclusion, this battle is three-way between 0, 1, and 2-100. 2-100 may look nice initially, but if the other 2 choose the same, the smallest number wins.

### 2 Players Left:

When there are only 2 players left, it is most ideal for the person who is behind in points to choose 100, and for the person in the lead to select 1 or 0. Although 0 is the most powerful number to choose from, it is also balanced by 100.

### Trivia
* The King of Diamonds is the hardest Diamonds game.
* It is a game of Keynesian Beauty Contest between 5 people.
* The Keynesian Beauty Contest was a famous experiment in behavioral economics. People voted from a list of women who they thought was the most beautiful, and the first place women received a prize. A 20th century economist, Keynes, linked these contests to equity investments.
* In summary, it was believed that to earn maximum profit, one mustn't invest in the market they think is best, they must invest in what everyone else thinks is best. This directly compares to the psychology used in the King of Diamonds game.
* “If there are 2 people or more who choose the same number, the number they choose becomes invalid, meaning they will lose a point even if the number is 4/5ths the average.” — The reason this rule is put into place is to ensure that there can no longer be a nash equilibrium. Because of that, a new sense of danger arises, but there’s also a deeper layer of strategy.
* “If someone chooses 0, the player who chooses 100 is the winner.”— The reason this rule is put into place is to balance the power of 0. By the time there are 2 players left, if anyone chooses 0, they’ll automatically win regardless of the number the other person choose. In that case, the person in the lead would continually pick 0. Even if the other player also choose 0, they’ll both lose points but the player with lesser points would die first. To balance that quirk, 100 overrides 0 as the victorious number.
* In addition, by rule 3, the game essentially becomes a game of rock, paper, scissors between the numbers 0, 1, and 100.
